# Assignment Project Overview

This project is a calendar booking system built with a modern Python backend and a separate frontend. It allows users to view available time slots, filter by event type, and book appointments. The backend manages slot data, booking logic, and exposes a RESTful API, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL, Alembic, Docker support
- **Frontend:** (see `frontend/README.md` for details)

## Structure
- `backend/` — Backend API and database logic (see `backend/README.md` for setup and API details)
- `frontend/` — Frontend application (see `frontend/README.md` for setup and usage)
- `data/` — JSON files for slot types and slot timings

## Quick Start
- See the detailed README files in each folder for setup, environment variables, and run instructions.
- Backend and frontend can be run independently or together, depending on your workflow.
